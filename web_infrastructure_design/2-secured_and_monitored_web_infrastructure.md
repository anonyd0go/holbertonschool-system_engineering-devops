## Summary

Weâ€™ve enhanced the existing threeâ€‘server LAMP infrastructure by introducing **three firewalls** for network segmentation and perimeter defense, an **SSL/TLS certificate** to serve encrypted HTTPS traffic for `www.foobar.com`, and **three monitoring agents** (e.g., Sumo Logic Installed Collectors) on each server to gather logs and metrics. Firewalls enforce traffic rules and isolate network zones; HTTPS ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of user connections; and monitoring agents continuously collect dataâ€”logs, metrics, and tracesâ€”for realâ€‘time observability. Weâ€™ll also cover how to track Queries Per Second (QPS) on your web servers and discuss residual architectural issues, including SSL termination at the load balancer, singleâ€‘primary database writes, and risks of colocating identical stacks on each node.

## Additional Infrastructure Components

### 1. Three Firewalls

* **Why**: To segment the network into secure zones (e.g., DMZ, application tier, database tier), minimizing lateral movement by attackers.
* **What**: At least one firewall at the edge (between Internet and LB) and one between each application server tier and the database tier.

### 2. SSL/TLS Certificate

* **Why**: To encrypt all traffic between clients and `www.foobar.com`, protecting user data from eavesdropping and ensuring authenticity via a trusted CA-issued certificate.

### 3. Three Monitoring Agents

* **Why**: To provide observability into server health, application performance, and security events. Agents send logs, metrics, and traces to a SaaS (e.g., Sumo Logic) for analysis and alerting.

## Component Roles & Operation

### Firewalls

* **Purpose**: Inspect and filter incoming/outgoing packets based on policy rules to block unauthorized access and malware.
* **Placement**:

  * **Edge Firewall**: Protects against Internet threats.
  * **Internal Firewalls**: Enforce segmentation between LB, app servers, and database nodes.

### HTTPS Encryption

* **Why HTTPS**: Encrypts data in transit (TLS), thwarts manâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘middle attacks, and verifies server identity to clients.
* **Certificate**: Deployed on the load balancer (or LB+app servers) for `www.foobar.com`, served on portÂ 443.

### Monitoring

* **What Itâ€™s For**: Realâ€‘time visibility into logs, metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O), and traces for performance tuning and incident response.
* **Data Collection**: Installed agents (e.g., Sumo Logic Installed Collector) run on each server, compress/encrypt data, and push it to the cloud platform over HTTPS.

### QPS Monitoring

* **Definition**: Queries Per Second measures how many requests or database queries a server processes per second.
* **How to Monitor**:

  * **Agent Metrics**: Use application server or Nginx status modules to expose QPS metrics (e.g., `/status`), scraped by agents.
  * **Log Parsing**: Monitoring agents parse access logs to count requests over time.
  * **Threshold Alerts**: Configure alerts if QPS exceeds capacity, indicating need for scaling or investigation.

## Remaining Issues & Considerations

### 1. SSL Termination at Load Balancer

* **Issue**: Traffic between LB and backend servers may be unencrypted, violating zeroâ€‘trust principles and exposing data on internal networks.

### 2. Single MySQL Write Primary

* **Issue**: Only one node accepts writes; if it fails, no writes can occur, and failover may be manual or slow. Also replication lag can cause stale reads.

### 3. Homogeneous Servers with Full Stacks

* **Issue**: Running web server, app server, and database on each node complicates security hardening (larger attack surface), resource contention, and maintenance (patching multiple roles on each machine).

**Next Steps**:

1. **Enable endâ€‘toâ€‘end TLS** between LB and backends or deploy certificates on each app server.
2. **Promote a replica** to primary automatically upon failure or adopt multiâ€‘primary clustering (e.g., MySQL Group Replication).
3. **Separate roles** onto dedicated servers or containers for better isolation.
4. **Implement SIEM** integration, intrusion detection, and alerting for a robust security posture.
